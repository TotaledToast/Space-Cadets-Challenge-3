Needed commands:
    clear <>
    incr <>
    decr <>

Needed 'Function':
    while <> not 0 do:
    ...
    ...
    end;

Regex Version of commands:
    ^(\s*)clear (.+);
    ^(\s*)incr (.+);
    ^(\s*)decr (.+);

    ^(\s*)while (.+) not 0 do;

    ^(\s*)end;

Regex Command Finder:
    ^(\s*)(.+) .*

//Dictionaries will be really useful to store 'variables'
//clear is also used to create new variables

System.out.println(element.replaceAll(<Regex Command Finder>, "$2"));
This will split the command from the rest of a regex statement.

System.out.println(element.replaceAll(<REGEX EXPERSSION>, "$2"));
This will split the desired variable name from the rest of the expression.

System.out.println(element.replaceAll(<REGEX EXPERSSION>, "$1"));
This will split the starting white space from the rest of the expression. Will be useful for while loops

Have to read text in from the file
cycle through each line in the file
decipher each command for a line
create or edit any variables if required
keep track of how indented while loops are (planning on finding the corresponding end; using how indented they are)
Create an output of all variable to keep get record of execution


File input = new File("Tester.txt");
        Scanner fileReader = new Scanner(input);
        while (fileReader.hasNextLine()){
            String line = fileReader.nextLine();
            System.out.println(line);
        }
        fileReader.close();
